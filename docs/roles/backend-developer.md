# Backend Developer Role Document - SkillSwap Connect

This document defines the expectations, responsibilities, technical requirements, and workflow guidelines for the Backend Developer working on SkillSwap Connect. It provides practical insights and examples to help align your contributions with the project objectives.

---

## 1. Role Overview

The Backend Developer is responsible for designing, implementing, and maintaining the server-side components of the SkillSwap Connect application. This role involves building robust RESTful API endpoints that enable secure communication between the client-side (frontend) and the database. You will develop the core authentication and authorization mechanisms using JWT and manage the data persistence layer with MongoDB. This role is vital to ensure that the system is secure, scalable, and supports seamless user interactions like session bookings, profile management, and user matching.

---

## 2. Key Responsibilities

### a. Design and Implement RESTful API Endpoints

- Create API endpoints that facilitate user registration, login, profile management, skill searches, matching, session bookings, and feedback submissions.
- Develop clear, well-documented endpoints to ensure smooth integration with the frontend.
  
*Example:*  
Implement a POST endpoint for user registration:
```javascript
app.post('/api/register', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const newUser = await User.create(req.body);
    res.status(201).json(newUser);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ message: 'Registration failed', error });
  }
});
```

### b. Develop Secure Authentication and Data Management Systems

- Implement JWT-based authentication to securely manage user sessions.
- Develop middleware for verifying tokens and protecting routes.
  
*Example:*  
JWT validation middleware sample:
```javascript
function verifyToken(req, res, next) {
  const token = req.headers['authorization'];
  if (!token) return res.status(403).json({ message: 'No token provided' });

  jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET, (err, decoded) => {
    if (err) return res.status(500).json({ message: 'Failed to authenticate token' });
    req.userId = decoded.id;
    next();
  });
}
```

### c. Manage Database Schemas and Integrate Session Scheduling Functionality

- Define and maintain MongoDB schemas for users, skills, sessions, and other resources, ensuring data integrity.
- Implement functionalities for booking and scheduling sessions, including conflict resolution and notifications.

*Example:*  
Schema snippet for a session booking:
```javascript
const sessionSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  tutor: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User', required: true },
  learner: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User', required: true },
  scheduledTime: { type: Date, required: true },
  status: { type: String, enum: ['pending', 'confirmed', 'completed', 'cancelled'], default: 'pending' },
});
```

## 3. Technical Requirements

- **Node.js/Express:**  
  Proficiency in building server-side applications with Node.js and Express is crucial for implementing APIs, middleware, and server logic.
  
- **MongoDB:**  
  Experience in designing MongoDB collections and using Mongoose (or native drivers) for schema definitions, query optimizations, and data validations.
  
- **JWT Authentication:**  
  Understanding of JWT for creating, signing, and verifying tokens ensures the secure management of user sessions.

- **RESTful API Design:**  
  Ability to design and implement RESTful services that follow industry best practices for scalability, maintainability, and documentation.

- **Additional Skills:**  
  Basic knowledge of version control (Git), testing frameworks (Jest, Mocha), and API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI).

---

## 4. Deliverables

- **API Endpoints Documentation:**  
  A detailed list of all endpoints (e.g., `/api/login`, `/api/register`, `/api/skill`, `/api/session`) with expected request/response payloads.
  
- **Functional Authentication Module:**  
  A fully tested JWT-based authentication system integrated into the API.
  
- **Database Schema Designs:**  
  Well-structured MongoDB schemas that support user and session management.
  
- **Error Handling & Logging:**  
  Middleware for comprehensive error handling and logging strategies to track API performance and issues.
  
- **Unit and Integration Tests:**  
  A suite of tests validating the functionality and security of API endpoints and business logic.

---

## 5. Integration Points

- **With Frontend Developer:**  
  Establish clear API contracts and documentation (e.g., using Swagger). Ensure endpoints meet the requirements for features like user authentication and real-time session booking.
  
- **Data Exchange:**  
  Use standardized JSON payloads for all API responses. Maintain backward compatibility or version the API when necessary.
  
- **Regular Communication:**  
  Participate in synchronization meetings to discuss API changes, troubleshoot integration issues, and coordinate updates on endpoint functionalities.

---

## 6. Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

- **Feature Branches:**  
  Create branches for each new feature or bug fix (e.g., `feature/user-authentication`).
  
- **Pull Requests (PRs):**  
  Open PRs for code review before merging to the main branch. Ensure the PR includes context, testing coverage, and documentation updates.
  
- **Release Branches:**  
  Use release branches to collate final changes before deployments.

### Code Review Process

- **Peer Reviews:**  
  Engage with team members for code reviews, emphasizing security, performance, and adherence to coding standards.
  
- **Automated Checks:**  
  Integrate linting and automated test runs in the CI/CD pipeline to catch errors and enforce best practices.

### Testing Approach

- **Unit Testing:**  
  Write tests for individual modules using frameworks like Jest or Mocha. Include tests for API endpoints, middleware, and business logic.
  
- **Integration Testing:**  
  Validate that different components (e.g., database interactions, authentication flows) work together as expected.
  
- **Manual Testing:**  
  Use tools like Postman to manually verify API endpoints during development.

---

## 7. Technical Decisions

- **Architecture & Frameworks:**  
  Decide on the Express and MongoDB setup, ensuring it's modular enough to scale with additional features.
  
- **Security Protocols:**  
  Choose best practices for JWT implementation and secure data transmission, including HTTPS enforcement and proper error handling.
  
- **Database Schema Design:**  
  Finalize schema designs that best support the application's data needs and relationships (e.g., user-to-session relationships).
  
- **Environment Configuration:**  
  Define and manage different environments (development, testing, production) for configuration settings (e.g., environment variables, connection strings).

- **Logging & Monitoring:**  
  Select logging frameworks (e.g., Winston) and integrate with monitoring systems to keep track of server health and errors.
