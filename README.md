## üìã Project Overview

SkillSwap Connect is an innovative web application designed to connect community members who want to share and learn new skills in a collaborative environment. This platform encourages skill exchange by allowing users to create profiles, list the skills they have to offer, and specify areas where they seek improvement. The application integrates robust user authentication using JWT, ensuring secure access for each member. The frontend is built with React to provide a dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly interface that adapts across devices, while the backend is developed using Node.js with Express and MongoDB for efficient data management. The architecture follows a RESTful API design, enabling seamless communication between components and smooth data flow. Key challenges include implementing a reliable matching algorithm for skill pairing, ensuring secure data transactions, and managing real-time session bookings. The project will be executed in iterative phases, starting with core backend development followed by UI/UX design, integration, and rigorous testing. This timeline facilitates continuous learning while addressing both technical and deployment challenges in a cloud environment to ensure scalability and performance.
